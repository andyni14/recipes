    <p>This is one of <em>Italy's</em> proud bread dishes. It was invented a century ago at <strong> Sicialian Deli</strong> in New Orleans. It consists of a halved muffuletta loaf with deli meats and olive spread
        What really sets this dish apart from others is the spicy, tangy olid salad!</p>
