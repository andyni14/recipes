        <li>1 tablespoon chopped celery</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon celery seed</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2(1 Pound) loaves Italian bread</li>
        <li>8 ounces of sliced genoa salami</li>
        <li>8 ounces of thinly sliced cooked ham</li>
        <li>8 ounces sliced mortadella</li>
        <li>8 ounces of sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Directions</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the olive salad: Chop together the green olives, Kalatmata olives, pepperoncini, cauliflower, cocktail onions, 
            garlic, capers, celery, and carrot</li>
        <li> Combine with oregano, basil, black pepper, and celery seed in a medium bowl. Add in olive oil, canola oil, and vinegar. 
            Mix together and transfer the mixture into a glass jar (or other nonreactive container). Pour in more oil to cover if needed.
        </li>
        <li>Cover jar or container and refrigerate at least 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>To make the sandwiches: Cut loaves of bread in half horizontally; hollow out some of the excess bread to make room for 
            filling. </li>
        <li>Spread each piece of bread with equal amounts of the olive salad, including oil. </li>
        <li>Layer bottom half of each loaf with 1/2 of the salami, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, and Provolone slices. </li>
        <li>Replace top half on each loaf and cut the sandwiches into quarters. </li>
        <li>Serve immediately, or wrap tightly and refrigerate for a few hours; this will allow for the flavors to mingle and the olive salad to soak into the bread. </li>
    </ol>
